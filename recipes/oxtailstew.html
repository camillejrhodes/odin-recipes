            <li> 12 ounces dried lima beans </li>
            <li> 4 pounds oxtails </li>
            <li> 2 large Vidalia onions, chopped </li>
            <li> 3 scallions, chopped </li>
            <li> 4 garlic cloves, smashed </li>
            <li> 1 bunch fresh thyme </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes </li>
            <li> 4 teaspoons hot paprika </li>
            <li> 2 bay leaves </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons hot sauce </li>
            <li> 4 tablespoons gravy master </li>
            <li> 6 cups low-sodium beef broth </li>
            <li> 4 teaspoons tomato paste </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons salt </li>
            <li> 2 cups rice </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large bowl, cover lima beans with water, cover with a towel and soak overnight. </li>
            <li> In a large pot, add oxtails, onions, scallions, garlic, thyme, red pepper, paprika, bay leaf, hot sauce, and gravy master and marinate at least 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li> Add enough water to just cover the oxtails and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower to a simmer, cover and cook 2 hours. Every 30 minutes for 2 hours add 2 cups of water or broth, alternating, as necessary, to keep oxtails covered with liquid. </li>
            <li> At 2 hours, add the beans, tomato paste, and 2 more cups of beef broth and water, if needed. Bring to a boil then simmer uncovered 2 hours, skimming fat off top and stirring occasionally. In the last 1/2 hour of cook time, season with 2 tablespoons salt. Serve with rice. </li>
            <li> Rinse rice 3 times to remove starch. Put rice in a medium saucepan. Fill saucepan with enough water to cover the rice by 1/2-inch or measure by placing your thumb tip on the rice and filling the pot with water until the water reaches the middle of your thumbnail. Bring rice to a simmer, cover and cook until tender and liquid is evaporated, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let rice stand another 5 minutes, covered. </li>
        </ol>
